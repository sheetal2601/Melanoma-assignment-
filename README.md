# Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a Melanoma Skin Cancer Detection project. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying melanoma, a type of skin cancer, through the analysis of skin lesion images.

# Introduction
Skin cancer, particularly melanoma, is a serious health concern. Early detection and diagnosis can significantly improve outcomes for patients. This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to assist in the automated detection of melanoma from skin lesion images.
